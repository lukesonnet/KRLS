\usage{
\method{plot}{krls2}(x, which = c(1:2),
  main = "distributions of pointwise marginal effects", setx = "mean",
  ask = prod(par("mfcol")) < nplots, nvalues = 50, probs = c(0.25,
  0.75), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{krls2} that preferably results from a call to 
\code{\link{summary.krls2}}. Also accepts the output of \code{\link{krls}} but
this is slower as it has to recompute pointwise marginal effects if the
histograms of pointwise marginal effects are requested by \code{which}.}

\item{which}{if a subset of the plots is required, specify a subset of the numbers \code{1:2}.}

\item{main}{main title for histograms of pointwise partial derivatives.}

\item{setx}{either one of \code{mean} or \code{median} to hold other
predictors at their mean or median values for the conditional expectation 
plots. Alternativeley the user can specific a numeric vector with predictor
values at which the other predictors should be fixed for the conditional
expectation plots. If specifed in this way there must be one value per
predictor and the order of the values much match the order of the predictor
used in the predictor matrix of the krls fit passed in \code{obj}.}

\item{ask}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the user is asked before each plot,
see \code{\link{par}} (\code{ask=.}).}

\item{nvalues}{scalar that specifies the number of values at which 
conditional expectations should be plotted.}

\item{probs}{vector with numbers between 0 and 1 that specify the quantiles
that determine the range for of the predictor values for which the 
conditional expectation should be plotted. By default we vary each 
predictor from the 1st quartile to the 3rd quartile value.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed to lower level functions}
}
\description{
Produces two types of plots. The first type of plot shows
histograms for the pointwise partial derivatives to examine the 
heterogeneity in the marginal effects of each predictor (\code{which}==1).
The second type of plot shows estimates of the conditional expectation
functions of \eqn{E[Y|X]} for each predictor (\code{which==2}). For each
plot, the predictor of interest varies from its 1st to its 3rd quartile values, while
the other predictors are kept at the means (or other values specified in 
\code{setx}). For binary varibales the \eqn{E[Y|X]} are predicted at the
max and the min value of the predictor (instead of the range from the 1st
to the 3rd quantile).
}
\details{
Notice that the histograms for the partial derivatives can only
 be plotted if the KRLS object is the result of \code{\link{summary.krls2}}.
